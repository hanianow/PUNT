### Probably Useless Neuroimaging Tools

A repository of auxiliary tools that I have written during my DPhil but they are not bringing any value to my research. However, they made my work easier, faster or looking better so maybe someone will find them useful as well.
(My main repo is private on Oxford Uni server and will be made public after relevant academic publications or DPhil (PhD) thesis defence)

Please, drop me (even a very short) note if it was useful, it would be great to hear back!
